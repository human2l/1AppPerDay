# 1AppPerDay

This is a repository for .NET course. Code written by frankyyyyy, gaowym and me in 2018.
This is a group work with limited time.
I tried so hard to make everything right. I still have to say these code is kind of massy.
Someday I might be interest to rebuilt it, maybe...

For now, I am focusing Angular + Spring. You can check the repository lms-new to see whatever you want :)
